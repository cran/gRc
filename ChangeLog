	* Bug fixed so that also unfitted models can be plotted

	* extractIndexMatrix has been implemented in C (there remains an
	issue of that the matrices are converted to doubles to get the
	code to work. That should not be necessary?)

	* Some trace functions are implemented in C

	* Finding standard representation has been speeded up

	* stepjoin1 now accepts a scope argument (stepsplit1 does not - yet!)

	* Various minor bugs fixed.
